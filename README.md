**using the forest as an example** 
This is a Trainer i make for <a href="https://www.pirateperfection.com" target="_blank">PiratePerfection</a> right now.
I decided to go for a more general way to do it so this "example" is highly convertible
There are still some features missing like the keybinding menu and stuff but otherwise it is kinda good 2 go
Also it is set up to work with an intern tool of ours. if you want to use it without becoming moderator on our forum you might need to get your hands dirty and make the edits of the override manually
if you have no clue how this might help you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuSm1uHxXIU
